<h1 align="center">CrowdX Smart Contract</h1>

A decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built on Ethereum.  
It allows users to **create campaigns**, **donate ETH**, **withdraw funds if goals are met**, and **claim refunds if campaigns fail**.  
This contract is designed to ensure **trustless fundraising** without the need for intermediaries.

## Overview

- Decentralized platform for crowdfunding.  
- Campaigns have a **title, description, goal amount, deadline, and owner**.  
- Users can **donate ETH** directly on-chain.  
- If the goal is reached before the deadline → campaign owner can **withdraw funds**.  
- If the goal is not reached before the deadline → contributors can **claim refunds**.  
- Transparent and immutable records of all donations.

##  Features

1. **Create Campaign** – Any user can create a campaign with a goal and deadline.  
2. **Donate ETH** – Contributors can fund campaigns using `donate()`.  
3. **Track Donations** – Each donor’s contribution is stored securely.  
4. **Withdraw Funds** – Campaign owners can withdraw if the goal is met.  
5. **Refunds** – Contributors can reclaim funds if the campaign fails.  
6. **Event Logging** – All actions emit events for easy off-chain indexing.

1. **Campaign Creation**  
   - A user creates a campaign with a funding goal and deadline.  

2. **Funding the Campaign**  
   - Supporters donate ETH directly on-chain.  
   - Each donation is tracked and linked to the donor.  

3. **Checking Progress**  
   - If total funds ≥ goal **before deadline** → campaign marked as successful.  
   - Otherwise → campaign marked as failed.  

4. **Post-Campaign Actions**  
   - **Successful campaign** → owner withdraws funds.  
   - **Failed campaign** → donors withdraw their ETH back.
